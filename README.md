# CultureConnect-Project
Hi! This is CultureConnect, a thesis project by Group 5 of the class BSCS701 in STI College Pasay-EDSA. Culture Connect is a software to be used on a raspberry pi device that is created in order to help Filipino language learners in their language learning journey particularly in Japanese, Chinese, and Korean.

DISCLAIMER: CultureConnect is a project created by utilizing already existing tools such as pre-existing language models, translation tools and etc. The main purpose of the system or device is to not only act as aid in language learning but to also show that it is possible to create such devices even with hardware and software limitations.
